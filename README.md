# Flash App README

This README file provides instructions on how to deploy a Flash app on AWS using CodePipeline. The app is built using the Flask web framework and can be deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The deployment process will be automated using AWS CodePipeline.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the Flash app using CodePipeline, make sure you have the following:

1. AWS account with appropriate permissions to create resources like Elastic Beanstalk, CodePipeline, and S3 buckets.
2. AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) installed and configured with access credentials.
3. The code for the Flash app hosted on a version control repository like GitHub or AWS CodeCommit.

## Step 1: Setting Up AWS Elastic Beanstalk Environment

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk service.
2. Click "Create a new environment."
3. Select "Web server environment" and choose the "Python" platform.
4. Choose "Upload your code" and upload your Flash app's code as a zip file.
5. Click "Create environment" to create your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

## Step 2: Creating an S3 Bucket

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
2. Click "Create bucket" and provide a unique name for your bucket.
3. Choose the region where you want to create the bucket and click "Create."

## Step 3: Creating the CodePipeline

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CodePipeline service.
2. Click "Create pipeline."
3. Enter a name for your pipeline and click "Next."
4. In the "Source" stage, select your version control provider (e.g., GitHub, CodeCommit) and provide the necessary credentials and repository information.
5. Click "Next."
6. In the "Build" stage, select "AWS Elastic Beanstalk" as the build provider.
7. Choose the region where you created your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
8. Select the environment you created earlier from the dropdown list.
9. Click "Next."
10. In the "Deploy" stage, choose "Amazon S3" as the deployment provider.
11. Select the S3 bucket you created earlier from the dropdown list.
12. Enter a unique object key prefix (e.g., `flash-app/`) and click "Next."
13. Review your pipeline configuration and click "Create pipeline."

## Step 4: Monitoring the Pipeline

1. Once the pipeline is created, CodePipeline will automatically trigger the deployment process whenever there is a new change in the version control repository.
2. You can monitor the progress of the deployment in the CodePipeline console.
3. After successful deployment, the Flash app will be accessible through the Elastic Beanstalk environment URL.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up an automated deployment pipeline for your Flash app using AWS CodePipeline. Now, any changes to your app's code in the version control repository will be automatically deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, making it easier to manage and update your application.
